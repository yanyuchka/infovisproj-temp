# Charts-for-CompStat

This project aims to enhance the NYPD crime trends and performance analysis by developing a web-based interactive visualization tool that communicates not only [traditional aggregation statistics] (http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/crime_prevention/crime_statistics.shtml), but one that would reveal other trends and events in the data, while using an open [dataset] (https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Motor-Vehicle-Collisions/h9gi-nx95) on Motor Vehicle Collisions published by the NYPD as a case study.

 



One can use this [notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/yanyuchka/Charts-for-CompStat/blob/master/smpl_stats_explr.ipynb) as a draft for playing around with the crash data.
